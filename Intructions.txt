  ~GENERAL IDEA~
  Create a pattern game that fades the pattern into view, than the user has to answer.
  If they are correct, a colored message should appear. (i.e. green if correct, red if wrong)
  The submit button should disappear revealing a next button after they are finished.

  ~SPECIFICATIONS~
  The user must enter their email address if they win. (use plugins to verify the email)
  There should be an animated celebration page if the user wins.
  You should also create your own plugin.
